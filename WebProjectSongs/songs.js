  Cigarettes After Sex
  ----------------------
  I'm a flash
  You were blinded by the love I had

  I'm a flash
  The light could only get in through the cracks

  *******************************************
  *  And you've gotta do the right thing    *  
  *  Do the right thing baby                * 
  *  You're the white swan in my photograph *
  *  Do the right thing                     *
  *  Do the right thing baby                *
  *  You're the white swan in my photograph *
  *******************************************

  When they crash the helicopters in my heart it ripped
  Cut in half, you saw me lying there bleeding to death

  *******************************************
  *  And you've gotta do the right thing    *  
  *  Do the right thing baby                * 
  *  You're the white swan in my photograph *
  *  Do the right thing                     *
  *  Do the right thing baby                *
  *  You're the white swan in my photograph *
  *******************************************

  Now I stand on the stage
  I forget my lines to your play, "Satan's Imagination"
  And a voice in my head's causing suicide searching for any way
  To remember them

  *******************************************
  *  And you've gotta do the right thing    *  
  *  Do the right thing baby                * 
  *  You're the white swan in my photograph *
  *  Do the right thing                     *

  Cigarettes After Sex

  You leapt from crumbling bridges, watching cityscapes turn to dust
  Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above

  Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
  Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
  You've been locked in here forever, and you just can't say goodbye

  Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
  You've been hiding them in hollowed-out pianos left in the dark

  Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
  Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
  You've been locked in here forever, and you just can't say goodbye

  Your lips, my lips
  Apocalypse
  Your lips, my lips
  Apocalypse

  Go and sneak us through the rivers
  Flood is rising up on your knees
  Oh, please

  Come out and haunt me, I know you want me
  Come out and haunt me

  Sharing all your secrets with each other, since you were kids
  Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist

  Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
  Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
  You've been locked in here forever, and you just can't say goodbye
  You've been locked in here forever, and you just can't say goodbye

  Cigarettes After Sex
  ---------------------
  When the sun goes down on my side of town
  That lonesome feeling comes to my door and the whole world turns blue

  There's a rundown bar across the railroad tracks
  Got a table for two way in the back
  Where I sit alone and think of you

  I spend most every night beneath the light of a neon moon

  If you lose your one and only
  There's always room here for the lonely
  To watch your broken dreams
  Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon

  I think of two young lovers running wild and free
  Close my eyes and sometimes see you
  In the shadows of this smoke-filled room

  No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
  Or how many lies that I've lied
  Telling my poor heart you'll come back one day...

  I spend most every night beneath the light of a neon moon

  If you lose your one and only
  There's always room here for the lonely
  To watch your broken dreams
  Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon

  But I'll be alright as long as there's light from a neon moon
  But I'll be alright as long as there's light from a neon moon...`

  Since I needed a distraction

  'Cause I wanna do everything
  That you want me to, to tell you the truth
  I need to stay alive
  So sad that I could die

  It's leading me on, every time we touch
  Leading me on, every time it hurts
  Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
  Missin' you only ever since we fell in love

  And I watched you do a line
  That you spread out on the table
  I don't need to see you wired
  I just wanna see you upside down

  I wanna do everything
  That you want me to, to tell you the truth
  I listen to you cry all night
  Through the telephone

  It's leading me on, every time we touch
  Leading me on, every time it hurts
  Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
  Missin' you only ever since we fell in love

  Couldn't say you didn't want me there
  When we were lyin' in my bed that night
  You were acting like a different person
  As if, suddenly, you wanted to just be friends
  I was hurting so I took a shower
  So you couldn't hear me, knowing I had to cry
  Sad to know that while my heart was breaking
  You were sleeping or just faking

  It's leading me on, every time we touch
  Leading me on, every time it hurts
  Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
  Missin' you only ever since we fell in love`

  Built an opera house for you in the deepest jungle

  I've got a love for you I just can't escape
  All of my love for you cuts me like barbed wire

  Ooh, I was meant to love you
  And always keep you in my life
  Ooh, I was meant to love you
  I knew I loved you at first sight

  If I abandoned love, I'd be a man without dreams (ooh)
  I'd rather be out there staring death right between its eyes now
  And I can still hear the sound of you crying through the night
  There in the opera house with no one else for miles

  Ooh, I was meant to love you
  And always keep you in my life
  Ooh, I was meant to love you

  Go to the strip club all alone

  It's driving me crazy all the time
  
  Well, I never wanted to be with you
